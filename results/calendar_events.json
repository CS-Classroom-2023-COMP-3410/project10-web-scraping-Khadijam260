With only a single smuggled score, they performed the celebrated oratorio sixteen times, including one performance before senior SS officials from Berlin and an International Red Cross delegation. Conductor Rafael Schächter told the choir, “We will sing to the Nazis what we cannot say to them.”Defiant Requiem: Verdi at Terezín is a concert-drama that was conceived and created by Foundation President, Maestro Murry Sidlin. It combines the magnificent music of Verdi with video testimony from survivors of the original Terezín chorus and footage from the 1944 Nazi propaganda film about Theresienstadt. The performance also includes actors who speak the words of imprisoned conductor Rafael Schächter and others.Defiant Requiem is not just a performance of the Verdi Requiem, but a tribute to the inspired leadership of Rafael Schächter who was forced to reconstitute the choir three times as members were transported to Auschwitz. The performances came to symbolize resistance and defiance and demonstrated the prisoners’ courage to confront the worst of mankind with the best of mankind. Defiant Requiem: Verdi at Terezín is powerful, dramatic and inspirational. For ticket questions, please contact the Newman Center Box Office at 303-871-7720.For all other Lamont questions, please call 303-871-6400."

      "description": "In 2018, the Correctional Service of Canada announced that it would be launching a new prison farm pilot project at two penitentiaries in Kingston, Ontario. The stated purpose was to provide incarcerated men with training and transferrable skills, and the “opportunity to work with livestock.” The program was promoted to the public as a good-news story focused on images of prisoners milking cows and bottle-feeding baby calves.Through a multi-year investigation, Evolve Our Prison Farms has uncovered over 45,000 pages of government records revealing the facts behind the façade of Canada’s prison farm program. It has published a new comprehensive report exposing the political underbelly of Canada’s prison farms, and how the meat and dairy industries have commandeered and commercialized prison labour in Canada. This presentation explores the story as revealed in government records, pieced together in Prison Farms Exposed: Revelations from Access to Information.Please register here."

      "description": "Help us Channel the Power of the Ancients! The ancient runes, hewn into the mossy boulders that dot Streedagh Beach in Ireland's County Slingo have puzzled scientists and  anthropologists for decades. Legends of their meaning have been passed down by word of mouth by the local villagers for generations. Some say the runes describe a story of a great sea beast that terrorized the village, some say they hold the recipe for a hearty and medicinal stew; but the mysteries of the runes have never been fully uncovered--- until now. Denver Brass has decoded the forgotten language and unlocked the secrets of the ancient Celtic ritual they describe. To pull this off and divine the disembodied spirits of the elder druids, we will need some help from our friends at Celtics Steps Irish Dance, Rocky Mountain Highland Dancers, Celtic Colorado Pipes and Drums, and Irish Tenor Todd Teske. Join Denver Brass as we perform the sacred rites of Celtic Awakening.Program Highlights: Danny Boy, Ancient Threads, Echoes of America, Skye Boat SongBuy TicketsPresented by The Denver Brass"
